<p>Disneyland, often referred to as the “<a href="https://www.disneydining.com/">Happiest Place on Earth</a>,” is a world-renowned theme Park known for its magical attractions and unforgettable experiences. However, even in this enchanting realm, the all-too-familiar frustration of dealing with line cutters can cast a shadow over the joyous atmosphere. Line cutters, those individuals who bypass queues and disregard the patience of fellow park-goers, create an unfortunate dilemma that challenges the very essence of fairness and shared enjoyment.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.disneydining.com/psa-disney-finally-addresses-bad-guest-behavior-em1/">Disneyland,</a> the iconic theme Park founded by Walt Disney himself, stands as a testament to imagination, creativity, and the power of storytelling. Disneyland Resort is home to captivating attractions, <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/disneyland-character-shows-undergarments-bwb1/">beloved characters,</a> and immersive <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/disney-attraction-breaks-down-and-guests-drops-down-bwb1/">experiences</a>. The Park has etched itself into the hearts of millions as a place where dreams truly come to life.</p>

<p>With all of these magical moments, Guests and families, friends, and individuals of all ages flock to the Parks to create lasting memories. <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/disney-finally-takes-a-stand-against-line-cutters-em1/">Waiting in line</a> is an integral part of the Disneyland experience, fostering anticipation and excitement as Guests inch closer to their chosen attraction.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Disneyland/comments/15ot96o/family_of_9_cut_to_the_front_of_space_mountain/">social media post</a>, a family was caught line-cutting when another Guest told a Cast Member as the family was boarding Space Mountain. This Disneyland Cast Member leaped into action by removing the family from the attraction. While line-cutting is not uncommon at Disney Parks, Guests should remember to be kind to others around them.</p>
<p><em>“CM was unaware and loaded them into the ride vehicle as a group. I let her know what they did and she kicked them all out of the ride,” a Guest shared.</em></p>
<p>Disneyland recognizes the importance of Guest satisfaction and works diligently to manage the issue of <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/walt-disney-world-attempting-to-put-a-stop-to-rampant-line-cutting-problem-ir1/">line cutting.</a> Park staff are trained to address such instances with professionalism and tact, ensuring that the disruptive behavior is curtailed without causing further disturbances.</p>
<p>How do you feel about the line cutters?</p>

Here’s how to re-experience Darth Vader in <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/huh-disney-misspells-name-of-character-on-new-merchandise-release-em1/"><i>Ahsoka</i> on Disney Plus</a>.</p>

<p>All <i>Star Wars </i>fans can discuss today is the newly released trailer for the upcoming and <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/its-time-to-prep-for-the-new-ahsoka-series-ma1/">highly anticipated Disney Plus streaming series <i>Ahsoka</i></a> starring Rosario Dawson. This new 45-second teaser trailer ominously begins with the line, “Everyone in the Order knew Anakin Skywalker, few would live to see what he became…”</p>
<p>Played by actor <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/evidence-suggests-anakin-skywalker-will-return-in-ahsoka-ma1/">Hayden Christensen in the three <i>Star Wars</i></a> prequels, Anakin Skywalker is a Jedi Knight who turned to the Dark Side of the Force, becoming Darth Vader under the influence of the evil Emperor Palpatine. Anakin becomes the iconic Sith Lord and one of the primary antagonists <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/fans-call-shocking-star-wars-detail-gross-shady-ma1/">in the original trilogy</a> after a grisly battle <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/obi-wan-kenobi-set-video-reportedly-revealed/">with Obi-Wan Kenobi</a> and murdering Mace Windu. Vader played a significant role in the rise and fall of the Galactic Empire.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.disneydining.com/new-ahsoka-poster-and-trailer-we-are-no-jedi-lf1/">Disney Plus’ <i>Ahsoka</i> series</a> picks up the story after the Clone Wars, and even though Lord Vader has already died at this point, we know that Anakin Skywalker was Ahsoka’s Jedi Master. She admits walking away from him, and the Jedi in the new teaser, and then the bomb drops.</p>
<p>Newly recorded dialogue from Hayden Christensen as Anakin weaves into the<a href="https://www.disneydining.com/grammy-nomination-received-by-john-williams-for-star-wars-galaxys-edge-theme/"> iconic, dramatic theme score</a>. He says, “In this war, you will face more than just droids. As your Master, it’s my responsibility to prepare you. I won’t always be there to look out for you. Don’t be afraid. Trust your instincts. I know you can do this, Ahsoka.”</p>

<p>What role do you think Anakin will play in the series? Will he only be featured in flashbacks of Ahsoka’s Padawan days?

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the luncheon Orlando Mayor Dyer along with <a href="https://www.disneydining.com/florida-orange-county-mayor-ends-state-of-emergency/">Orange County</a> Mayor Jerry Demmings showed off the new shuttle and revealed that it would be called the Swan Shuttle. The small white bus will circle the street of Creative Village in a route that will take approximately 15 minutes. Even more exciting, it will be completely free! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jacques Coulon, Orlando’s Transportation Planning Manager said, “Once it’s running, ride it. But don’t just ride it, give us feedback,” “We want to know what did you love about it, what didn’t feel quite right, what we need to adjust. Transit only works when it’s comfortable, accessible and more convenient than driving your car.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city will begin with just one shuttle as a pilot program in order to test out the idea of a self-driving bus but they hope to expand the program to cover more areas, including the tourism corridor and areas surrounding major theme parks. Mayor Demmings shared his thoughts on tourism use saying, “look for the prospects…of not just having Beep and autonomous vehicles downtown but also in our International Drive corridor,” he said. “The prospects for that are great.”</span></p>

<p>(NEXSTAR) – Does it feel like a totally different climate when you go across town? It may be the urban heat island effect. </p>
<p>The way a city is designed can make hot weather feel even worse. The temperature on your block is influenced by everything from the number of trees on the street to the color of the pavement. When trees and vegetation (which absorb heat) are replaced by buildings and roads (which can radiate heat), it feels hotter. </p>
<p>“The heat island effect can result in significant temperature differences between rural and urban areas,” <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://sor.epa.gov/sor_internet/registry/termreg/searchandretrieve/glossariesandkeywordlists/search.do;jsessionid=Bvpr-ulzxgjwbeqUzsm41EvsmoCdPQiFMen7vH8VkI1Ikf_6Drge!500592598?details=&amp;vocabName=Heat%20Island%20Effect%20Glossary&amp;filterTerm=urban%20heat%20island%20effect&amp;checkedAcronym=false&amp;checkedTerm=false&amp;hasDefinitions=false&amp;filterTerm=urban%20heat%20island%20effect&amp;filterMatchCriteria=Contains" target="_blank">explains the Environmental Protection Agency</a>.</p>

<p>Climate Central, an organization of scientists and journalists focused on studying the impacts of climate change, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/urban-heat-islands-2023" target="_blank">broke down 44 cities into Census blocks</a> to determine which neighborhoods suffer from the worst urban heat effects.</p>
<p>You can see a map of San Diego County’s urban heat hot spots below.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://fox5sandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2023/08/2023UHI_sandiego_en_title_lg.jpg"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A map shows the effects of urban heat in neighborhoods around San Diego County. (Climate Central)</figcaption></figure>
<p>San Diego County showed the worst impact concentration near downtown San Diego and neighboring cities Coronado, Chula Vista and National City, while the more rural areas in East and North County saw the least impact.</p>
<aside class="ad-unit ad-unit--mr1_ab">
</aside>
<p>Those communities in the dark red portions of the map live in a Census tract where the urban heat effect is 8 degrees or higher – “meaning that on a day when temperatures in a park outside the city are 90°F, it feels like 98°F or higher,” the report explains.</p>
<p>For each census tract, Climate Central researchers determined the urban heat index, which shows how much hotter it feels in those neighborhoods because of the built environment. The city with the worst urban heat index was New York, the analysis found. </p>
<p>In some cities, like Indianapolis, Albuquerque and San Jose, the worst impacts are concentrated in the cities’ downtown cores. In other cities, like Dallas, Detroit and Phoenix, the urban heat effect is spread throughout.</p>

<p>Los Angeles has what Climate Central calls “sprawling heat intensity,” which means the urban heat effect happens over a vast area that is highly developed. Downtown Los Angeles and industrial areas are worst, but there are few pockets of the massive city where you can find an urban heat effect less than 7 degrees.</p>

<p>Climate Matters analyzed the urban heat spots of 44 U.S. cities. (See <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.climatecentral.org/graphic/urban-heat-islands-2023?graphicSet=Urban+Heat+Island+Map" target="_blank">all the maps and results here</a>.)</p>
<p>The researchers also named a number of solutions – both short-term and long-term – to the urban heat problem. Planting trees can help, especially as those trees mature and grow larger to increase shade. Roof materials that reflect heat, as well as rooftop gardens, can cool things down in dense neighborhoods. </p>
<p>One of the hottest parts of any city is dark pavement that’s been soaking up the sun. Asphalt and concrete can even radiate heat after the sun goes down, keeping a neighborhood from cooling down at night. The <a href="https://www.epa.gov/heatislands/using-cool-pavements-reduce-heat-islands" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EPA</a> suggests looking into “cool pavement” technology as a solution.</p>

<p>SAN DIEGO — A Cessna Citation business jet was instructed to discontinue landing at the San Diego International Airport Friday to avoid a plane that was still on the runway.</p>
<p>That’s according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), who told FOX 5 officials are investigating a “go-around” that occurred shortly before noon local time. </p>

<p>The term “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.flysfo.com/information-about-go%E2%80%90arounds" target="_blank">go-around</a>” refers to flight procedure in which an arriving aircraft aborts its landing and returns to the landing queue. Officials say these instances are initiated if a pilot or air traffic controller is not completely satisfied that the requirements for a safe landing are in place.</p>
<aside class="inline-related-stories">   </aside>
<p>According to the FAA, preliminary review of the event showed that an air traffic controller instructed the pilot of a Cessna Citation business jet to discontinue landing because a Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 was still on the runway awaiting clearance to depart.</p>
<p>In the following statement, the FAA explained the situation further:</p>
<p>“The controller had previously cleared the Citation to land on Runway 27 and then instructed Southwest Flight 2493 to taxi onto that runway and wait for instructions to depart. The facility’s automated surface surveillance system alerted the controller about the developing situation.”</p>
<aside class="ad-unit ad-unit--mr1_ab">

<p>The FAA is sending a team of experts to the San Diego facility to investigate. Officials say the team will determine the closest proximity between the airplanes as part of the review.</p>

<p>JULIAN, Calif. — Astronomy enthusiasts and star gazers are in for special treat this weekend as the Perseid meteor shower is expected to peak over San Diego County. </p>
<p>For those looking for the perfect place to watch this celestial event, the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.julianstarfest.com/" target="_blank">Julian StarFest</a> is finally back after a two-year break due to the pandemic.</p>

	<a href="https://fox5sandiego.com/news/local-news/best-meteor-shower-of-the-year-to-peak-over-san-diego-this-weekend-nasa/?ipid=promo-link-block1" class="promo-link__link" target="&quot;_blank&quot;" rel="noopener"><br />
		This weekend’s Perseid meteor shower will peak at this time in San Diego	</a><br />
</aside>
</div>
<p>The San Diego Astronomy Associations is hosting a free public Star Party at the event Saturday night.</p>
<p>“This is definitely the big event for the meteor shower! There will be many astronomers there,” said Cathy Handzel, member of the San Diego County Chapter of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://darksky.org/" target="_blank">International Dark Sky Association</a> (IDA).</p>
<p>Organizers are expecting around 1,000 people to attend the Julian StarFest, which is taking place below the dark skies at <a href="https://menghiniwinery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Menghini Winery</a>. </p>
<p>The Star Party begins at 7 p.m. and will last until 11 p.m. Attendees can come early to check out merchant booths, participate in crafts in the picnic area, stroll the swap meet area, or enjoy wine tasting. </p>

<p>The full schedule for the Julian StarFest can be found <a href="https://www.julianstarfest.com/files/2023%20Event%20Schedule.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Associate Professor of Astronomy at San Diego State University, Douglas Leonard is set to speak at the Star Party with topics like the explosion of Betelgeuse — a red supergiant star. He will be joined by other astronomy experts.</p>
<p>This year may prove better luck for sky gazers since the waning crescent moon will allow for better viewing compared to last year’s bright full Moon. </p>
<p>Julian may be one of the best places to catch this meteor shower as the Julian Dark Sky Network has worked to preserve its dark skies.</p>
